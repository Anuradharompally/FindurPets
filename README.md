# Pet CRUD APP
### Practical Questions
##### What is this? What problem does it solve?
This app will use the Petfinder API to source adoption agencies local to the user, allowing them a convenient way to view those agencies and their available pets. Many adoption agencies do not have a solid, updated online presence, and we aim to create an easy to navigate, functional site for researching your local shelters & their pets.


##### User Stories
The high level goal for this app is to help connect the user with a place where they can find, research, and adopt animals that are in need of 'forever' homes from shelters in their area.


- The user will be able to search for animals by species, breed, age, and assorted others options (housetrained, age, etc)


- The user will be able to save pets they have viewed to track them, similar to many retail/ecommerce sites shopping cart functionality


- The user will be able to access the contact information of the location (shelter, breeder) of a pet


- The user will be able to provide their location to filter to local results and show nearby shelters


### Technologies used
##### Node.js
- **Express.js** framework for routing and controlling user flow
- **Bcrypt** node module for password encryption
- **Request** node node module for server side http requests

##### MongoDB
- **Mongoose.js** for object modeling in Express in conjunction with MongoDB

##### js / css / html
- **General** web building tools and applications
