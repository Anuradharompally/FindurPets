# Pet CRUD APP
### Practical Questions
##### What is this? What problem does it solve?
This app will use the Petfinder API to source adoption agencies local to the user, allowing them a convenient way to view those agencies and their available pets. Many adoption agencies do not have a solid, updated online presence, and we aim to create an easy to navigate, functional site for researching your local shelters & their pets.


##### User Stories
The high level goal for this app is to help connect the user with a place where they can find, research, and adopt animals that are in need of 'forever' homes from shelters in their area.


- The user will be able to search for animals by species, breed, and assorted others options (housetrained, age, etc)


- The user will be able to save pets they have viewed to track them, similar to many retail/ecommerce sites shopping cart functionality


- The user will be able to access the contact information of the location (shelter, breeder) of a pet


- The user will be able to authorize use of their location to show nearby shelters
